// Command is a domain command that is sent to a Dispatcher.
//
// A command name should 1) be in present tense and 2) contain the intent
// (MoveCustomer vs CorrectCustomerAddress).
//
// The command should contain all the data needed when handling it as fields.
// These fields can take an optional "eh" tag, which adds properties. For now
// only "optional" is a valid tag: `eh:"optional"`.
